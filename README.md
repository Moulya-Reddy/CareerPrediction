# CareerPrediction
This project leverages Machine Learning to predict a student's career path based on their personality traits and various aptitudes. It aims to assist individuals in understanding how their traits influence career options and make informed decisions.

"Features":

The model uses the following traits and aptitudes as input features:

OCEAN Traits: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism
Aptitudes:
Numerical Aptitude,
Spatial Aptitude,
Perceptual Aptitude,
Abstract Reasoning and 
Verbal Reasoning

"Algorithm":

The project uses the Random Forest algorithm for career prediction, chosen for its robustness and accuracy.

"Dataset":

The dataset currently includes a limited number of career options, but it can be expanded to improve the scope and diversity of predictions.

Future Improvements

Expanding the dataset to include more career options.
Improving model accuracy and refining predictions.
Enhancing interpretability of results to provide more actionable insights.
